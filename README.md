# Prework - iOS101 Prework

Submitted by: Gwendolyn Smith-Hill

Codepath iOS101 Prework is an app that introduces students to the XCode and the Swift language. Students create a demo app to become familiar with some of the features they will utilize in the CodePath course.

Time spent: 18 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
- [ ] Text color will change depending on the darkness of the background color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

**Apps That Inspire Me:** 

- Notes
  -  Can create and edit simple text-based notes and to-do lists.
  -  Can implement functionality to save and delete notes.
  -  Can categorize notes into different folders or tags for better organization.
    
- Youtube
  -  Can enable users to like or dislike videos.
  -  Users can play and pause videos.
  -  Users can share videos with others through different platforms.
    
- Twitter
  -  Users can follow and unfollow other accounts.
  -  Can retweet and like tweets from other users.
  -  A notification system to alert users about new posts and interactions.
    
- Speechify
  -  Implements text-to-speech functionality to read out text.
  -  Allows users to play and pause the speech playback.
  -  Implements a feature that highlights the currently spoken text.
    
- Kindle
  -  Can import and read eBooks in different formats.
  -  Can bookmark pages for easy reference.
  -  Users can highlight and annotate text in eBooks.

**App Idea:**

Using these apps as inspiration, I would like to create an educational app to assist beginner programmers in their learning 
journey. The app will combine the functionalities of a note-taking app, a YouTube-like platform, and a text-to-speech tool.
Users can create and organize notes on various programming concepts, languages, and algorithms. They will then be able to
categorize them for easy reference. The app will also offer a curated library of programming tutorials that cover different 
topics, recommended based on the user's progress and interests. A unique feature will be its text-to-speech capability. This 
will allow users to listen to their notes about their preferred programming language while also being able to adjust the 
speech speed for optimal comprehension. To further enhance the learning experience, the app will include a dark mode for 
extended study sessions. The app will ultimately allow seamless synchronization of notes and progress across 
devices. 


## Notes

The biggest challenge that I faced was getting the software to install properly. Because XCode requires a certain MacOS version, all systems needed to be upgraded to ensure the download was successful. After downloading, I had to get used to the features of XCode and the Swift programming language.

The other problem that I faced was learning the syntax. My goal was to take the app a step further and allow the label's text color to change based on the darkness of the background. Although I was able to get it to operate as desired, it will take more exposure and practice to grasp.
